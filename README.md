# Nagma Console

A simple console class that can be used in any C# project.

## Builds

You can download the latest binary for .NET Framework 3.5 here.

### .NET Framework 3.5?

The main reason at the beggining of the project was to have a console class that could be used in a Unity engine project, which, at the time, compiled to Mono 3.5.

## How to use

You can find an example implementation in the "ConsoleSample" project.
